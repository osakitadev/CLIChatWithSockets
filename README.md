# chat-with-sockets
This is just a personal project made with Go to practice some
concepts and for fun. I will improve it in the future!

## HOW TO USE
First of all, you need to have `Go 1.23.4` (the one I have) installed in your computer. Then run these commands:

1. `go run server.go` To start the server (do it once)
2. `go run client.go` To join the chat, you can execute it several times to have more users in the chat

## TODO LIST
- [x] Messages Rate Limit (to prevent spamming messages)
- [x] More commands in-chat
- [] Client's code rework
- [] Fix some code to improve it
- [] Make a better rate limiter
